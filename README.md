## Social Media App focusing on simple text posting.

Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the amount of content that traditional social media apps like Facebook and Twitter show you? Me too. SimpleTxt focuses on plain-old text for user interactions. A microblogging app, very easy and straightforward to enjoy, sign up now!

### Functional Description

This app allows users to create their accounts, log in, and start making short, 150 character posts on their timelines. The user can go to the "Search" page to find other available users and "follow" them. Doing so will add their posts to the user's timeline. The user can make new posts, like posts made by other users, and reply to those posts. Follower, following, likes and post counts are updated in real time.

The users can go to the "Profile" page to see her/his profile details, and access the "Settings" page to alter their name, bio or profile photo.

## Development info:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
